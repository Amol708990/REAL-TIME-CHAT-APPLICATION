# Real-Time Chat Application

This is a **Real-Time Chat Application** built using **Node.js** for the backend and **React.js** for the frontend. The application allows multiple users to send and receive messages instantly in real-time. It uses **Socket.IO**, a library that enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.

---

## Project Overview

The Real-Time Chat Application is designed to provide an interactive platform where users can communicate instantly. The backend is developed using Node.js, which handles all server-side logic including connections, message broadcasting, and message history management. The frontend is built with React.js, providing a dynamic and responsive interface for users to interact with the chat system.

Users can open multiple browser tabs to simulate multiple users, and messages will instantly appear across all connected clients. This project demonstrates the practical implementation of WebSocket-based communication and helps learners understand how frontend and backend systems communicate in real-time.

The project folder is structured as follows:

- `backend`: Contains server-side Node.js code for handling chat functionality.  
- `frontend-react`: Contains React.js code for the client-side user interface.  

---

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Messages appear instantly across all connected clients.
 
- **Responsive Interface**: Works on different screen sizes including desktops and tablets.
 
- **Message History**: Maintains messages so users joining later can see past messages.
 
- **Multi-Tab Testing**: Allows testing multiple users using multiple browser tabs.
  
- **Easy-to-Learn Code**: Structured for beginners to understand backend and frontend integration.

## Installation

To run this application locally, you need:

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
  
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)  

Follow the steps below:

### Backend Setup

1. Open Command Prompt or Terminal and navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\madxr\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\realtime-chat-app\backend"

2.Install all dependencies:

npm install

3.Start the backend server:

node server.js

The server will run on port 5000.

You should see the console message:

Server running on port 5000

### Frontend Setup

1.Open a new Command Prompt or Terminal and navigate to the frontend-react folder:

cd "C:\Users\madxr\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\realtime-chat-app\frontend-react"

2.Install React and Socket.IO client:

npm install

npm install socket.io-client

3.Start the frontend application:

npm start



The app will open automatically in your default browser at: http://localhost:3000

You should see a clean chat interface with an input box and a send button.

##How to Run and Test

Make sure the backend server is running first.

Open multiple browser tabs to simulate multiple users.

Type a message in the input box in any tab and click Send.

The message will instantly appear in all other open tabs.

You can also check the backend console for connection logs and message events.

Tip: Always ensure the backend is running before starting the frontend, otherwise messages will not be sent.
